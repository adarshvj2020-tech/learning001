## About Me
üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Adarsh Shaju

üëÄ I am presently leading a team of exceptional Computational Biologists and Clinical Data Scientists around cardiorenal and neuronal trials at the convergence of omics, clinical data, drug assets and, precision medicine. Previously, I worked on finding therapeutic targets and, currently the focus is more on biomarkers (prognostic/predictive/response) for multiple cardiometabolic (e.g., Chronic Kidney, Atherosclerosis, Heart Failure, Diabetes, Liver, Neurodegenerative, etc.) diseases. We combine data-driven and knowledge-driven avenues to facilitate Precision Medicine by leveraging the integration of bulk and single-cell multi-omics data alongside clinical data from human observational biobanks and clinical trials

üå± My role enables and provides the opportunity and privilege to collaborate, engage, mentor PhD, PostDocs, Clinical Data Scientists and, Computational Biologists working in Healthcare, Clinical Omics, Applied AI/ML in Medicine

üíª Previously, I also worked on omics projects involving preclinical data with interventional designs e.g., knockout or drug-treated at single cell or bulk multi-omics level

üíûÔ∏è I also collaborate on developing applied machine learning models using publicly available data with curious students or researchers and contribute to open science and open source modeling. I am fascinated by the potential of high-dimensional and high-throughput biomedical data.

  Experienced in algorithm development, Software Development, deployment, and unit testing for both business and scientific innovation. In this organization I worked both as a Software Developer and an IT infrastructure maintenance consultant within Retail and Life Sciences vertical as a part of Master Data Management (MDM) horizontal in a matrix setting. My final project was that of a Support Programmer Analyst maintaining and enhancing a Life Science Database using Oracle (SQL programming) for a leading pharmaceutical company where I handled critical issues, performed bug analysis and system integration via  programmatic solution.
